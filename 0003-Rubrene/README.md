# Rubrene with Path Integral Quantum Dynamics

To-Do:

- [x] Get the workflow running with an effective Spectral Density (some fit of the existing SD curves in QD code) for 1D Rubrene problem

- [ ] Get a curve fit spectral density with all the phonon modes working with the code (proving to be a bit annoying) for 1D Rubrene problem.

- [ ] How to get mobility from ($\rho$, t)? (also need to decide what other params we're hoping to get from the ($\rho$, t) results)

- [ ] Parameterise the Hamiltonian with DFT and TrESP to work on higher dimensional Rubrene and get started on other materials.
