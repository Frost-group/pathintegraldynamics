Enter 'y' to choose atomic unit input/output; 'n' for cm-1 and fs:
  'y'
Enter type of system ('sysdisc' or 'syscont'): 
  'sysdisc'  
If this is a continuous system, give mass and minimum/maximum coordinate values:
  1.   201   -6.  6. 
Enter number of system states: 
  2
Enter 'y' for local baths, 'n' for common bath:
   'n'
For local baths, enter the distance between ground and excited states:
  2.
Enter type of bath ('specdisc' or 'speccont') and choose Ohmic or numerical J(w).
For continuous bath enter the number of frequency grid points starting from w=0. 
For Ohmic spectral density enter the Kondo parameter xi and cutoff frequency wc:
  'speccont'  'Ohmic'  80001  2.0  1.0

For discrete system and common bath, enter the coordinates of the system sites:
  -0.  2. 
Enter initially populated site for which results are printed:
  1
Enter method to be used for iteration: iQuAPI or SMatPI (spelled this way!) 
 SMatPI
For SMatPI iteration choose within-memory method: 1=QuAPI, 2=BlipSum, 3=TEMPO
