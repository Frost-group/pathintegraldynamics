# Rubrene with Path Integral Quantum Dynamics

To-Do:

- [x] Get the workflow running with an effective Spectral Density (some fit of the existing SD curves in QD code) for 1D Rubrene problem

- [x] Get a curve fit spectral density with all the phonon modes working with the code (proving to be a bit annoying) for 1D Rubrene problem (Workflow works and it's running but taking forever!)

- [x] How to get mobility from ($\rho$, t)? (DOI : 10.1039/C9CP04770K)

- [ ] Parameterise the Hamiltonian with DFT and TrESP to work on higher dimensional Rubrene and get started on other materials.
