## Testing julia codes for nonadiabatic path integral methods


Some interesting things to try :


- [x] Reimplement a spin-boson model

- [ ] Reimplement a Tully model.

- [ ] Compare QuAPI + TTM and BlipSum + TTM with QuAPI + SMatPI and BlipSum+ SMatPI for same system.

- [ ] Photosynthesis PS-2 systems.
