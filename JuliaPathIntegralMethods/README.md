## Testing julia codes for nonadiabatic path integral methods


Some interesting things to try :


- [x] Reimplement a spin-boson model

- [ ] Reimplement a Tully model.

- [x] Compare QuAPI with SMatPI + QuAPI from PathSum (Matches most when kmax = 1 in QuantumDynamics ; Is PathSum SMatPI + QuAPI non-Markovian??)

- [ ] Compare BlipSum with SMatPI + BlipSum from PathSum (Blips slow)

- [ ] Compare QuAPI + TTM and BlipSum + TTM with QuAPI + SMatPI and BlipSum+ SMatPI for same system. (TTM too slow)

- [ ] Photosynthesis PS-2 systems. 

- [ ] FMO complex from Bose JCP paper, try with other methods
